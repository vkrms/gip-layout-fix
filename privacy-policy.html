                        accurate; your data is being processed unlawfully, but you do not want your data to be erased;
                        it is no longer necessary for us to hold your personal data for the purposes of our processing,
                        but you still require that personal data in relation to a legal claim; and you have objected to
                        processing, and are waiting for that objection to be verified. Where processing has been
                        restricted for one of these reasons, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we
                        will only process it for other reasons: with your consent; in relation to a legal claim; for the
                        protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public
                        interest.</p>
                    <h3>Your right to object to processing.</h3>
                    <p>You can object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular
                        situation, but only as far as our legal basis for the processing is that it is necessary for:
                        the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of any official
                        authority vested in us; or the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party.
                        If you make an objection, we will stop processing your personal information unless we are able
                        to: demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, and that these legitimate
                        grounds override your interests, rights and freedoms; or the processing is in relation to a
                        legal claim.</p>
                    <h3>Your right to object to direct marketing.</h3>
                    <p>You may instruct us at any time not to process your personal information for marketing purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal
                        information for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of the
                        use of your personal information for marketing purposes.</p>
                    <p>You can object to us processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you make an
                        objection, we will stop processing your personal data for this purpose.</p>
                    <h3>Your right to object for statistical purposes.</h3>
                    <p>You can object to us processing your personal data for statistical purposes on grounds relating
                        to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for performing a task carried
                        out for reasons of public interest.</p>
                    <h3>Automated data processing.</h3>
                    <p>To the extent that the legal basis we are relying on for processing your personal data is
                        consent, and where the processing is automated, you are entitled to receive your personal data
                        from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, you may not have
                        this right if it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
                    <h3>Complaining to a supervisory authority.</h3>
                    <p>If you think that our processing of your personal data infringes data protection laws, you can
                        lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do this
                        in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the
                        alleged infringement.</p>
                    <h2>Right to withdraw consent.</h2>
                    <p>To the extent that the legal basis we are relying on for processing your personal data is
                        consent, you are entitled to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the
                        lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
                    <h3>Exercising your rights.</h3>
                    <p>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us in
                        addition to the other methods specified above.</p>
